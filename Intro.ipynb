The course is designed for both quantitative scientists and brain imaging researchers; materials are organized in a way that no advanced knowledge in network science or brain imaging is required.\n",

    "* Understand the concepts behind various network analysis techniques to examine properties of brain networks\n",

Docker is similar to a virtual machine (a computer inside your computer), but is much simpler and requiring far less resources to run than a virtual machine. Docker enables you to install and run a bundle of software packages and libraries known as a Docker image.\n",

    "You can install necessary software tools and libraries (listed in the syllabus) directly on your computer. This option requires more effort and expertise on your part, but the installed tools will likely run faster than the Docker option."
